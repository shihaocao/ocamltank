Tank Game - 3110 Final

By: Shihao Cao, Kaitlyn Chen, and Jerry Sun

This project is an OCaml implementation of the classic Wii Play Tank game. The 
user can load in 1 of 4 pre-generated maps and play as a blue tank whose 
objective is to destroy all enemy red tanks. Use WASD-keys to move around the
constrained, continuous map, and use your cursor to aim projectiles and 
left-click to shoot them. All tanks can die in one hit and shoot bullets
that bounce (once for the player, twice for the enemies). There are also
physical obstacles in the world map such as walls and ditches that obstruct
the tanks' as well as the projectiles movement. If you kill all enemy
tanks without dying, you win that level!

With an X Server open, run "make play" in terminal and enter in
"level1.json" to start playing.
